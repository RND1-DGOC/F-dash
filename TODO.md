# Login Page Enhancement Plan

## Information Gathered
- Current login.html is malformed: missing proper HTML structure, duplicate scripts, no CSS link.
- styles.css has dashboard styles but no specific login page styles.
- Project is a Crane Monitor dashboard with British palette (navy, royal blue, red).
- Login page has username/password fields, sign-in button, error display, and logo.

## Plan
- Fix login.html structure: add head/body, link styles.css, consolidate scripts.
- Add login-specific CSS to styles.css: centered layout, gradient background, animations, modern card design.
- Ensure responsive design and accessibility.

## Dependent Files to be Edited
- Dashboard/login.html: Restructure HTML and scripts.
- Dashboard/styles.css: Add login page styles.

## Followup Steps
- Test login functionality after changes.
- Verify responsive design on different screen sizes.

## Changes Made
- [x] Dashboard/login.html: Restructured with proper HTML5 structure, added form labels, improved accessibility.
- [x] Dashboard/styles.css: Added comprehensive login page styles with gradient background, glassmorphism effects, smooth animations, and responsive design.
